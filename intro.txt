Backend is communication with each other through different types -
1. through Http request 
2. through web sockets
3. through pub and subs(publisher and subscriber)
4. by message queues
5. by polling

Advanced backend communication examples are - 
transcations in paytm  googlePay , code submission in leetcode codeforces , Driver tracker in uber , bitcoin withdrawal .


--------------------------------------------------------Web sockets------------------------------------------------------

- Websockets is a full duplex mode of persistent communication between the client and the server . It not wait for the response back whereas http wait for res return back and after return response it close the connection and make new connection again . But websockets communicate over a single TCP connections .

- In http handshake happens at every time when we call to backend but in websocket handshake happen only in starting .

- In nodejs we make http request by many methods like http , express or many more . But we use express mostly time beacause it provide good routing , middlewares , good ecosystem etc.

- In Websockets initial we also we make a http request then do some advanced thing to convert this connection in websocket connection thatswhy we need a http library like express or inbuilt http-bundle provide by nodeJS .
