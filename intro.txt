--------------------------------------------------------Web sockets------------------------------------------------------

- Websockets is a full duplex mode of persistent communication between the client and the server . It not wait for the response back whereas http wait for res return back and after return response it close the connection and make new connection again . But websockets communicate over a single TCP connections .

- In http handshake happens at every time when we call to backend but in websocket handshake happen only in starting .
